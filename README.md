# Urygem

Welcome to the Urygem! To get the information, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'urygem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install urygem

## Usage

You have some routes to get information about the popular serie "Pokémon".

In each path, you need to access the "Urygem" module in the bin/console to get the data.

The first is to have a list of the top 20 pokémon. You only need to put:
    
    $ Urygem.pokemons
and you will get the list with the ID and the name of the pokémon.


If you want to get more pokémon in this format, use the `list_pokemons_limits` method, but you must provide a parameter. It must be a integer because it indicates the amount of pokémon that will be returned. An example:

    $ Urygem.list_pokemons_limits(50)
You will get the list of the first 50 pokémon.


The next is to get information on a single pokémon. Use the `pokemon` method, you also have to give a parameter. It can be a string (the pokémon's name) or an integer (the pokémon's ID). An example:

    $ Urygem.pokemon("bulbasaur") # or Urygem.pokemon(45)
You will get ALL, seriously, ALL the pokémon information.


The last one is for the ways you can find a pokémon. Use the method `encounter_method` given a parameter. A string (the name) or an integer (the ID) for the parameter. An example:

    $ Urygem.encounter_method("surf") # or Urygem.encounter_method(10)
You will get the name, the ID and some translations of this method.
